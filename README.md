# Road-signs-classification-dataset
Data collection: A dataset of labeled road sign images would need to be gathered and prepared for training the model. This dataset would typically include a variety of different road signs, such as stop signs, speed limit signs, and yield signs, and would need to include a diverse set of images with varying lighting conditions, angles, and other factors.
Model design: The model used to classify road signs would likely be a convolutional neural network (CNN). This type of network is well-suited to image classification tasks because it is able to automatically learn features from the images that are useful for recognizing and classifying different objects. TensorFlow can be used to implement and design the CNN architecture.
Training: The model would be trained on the dataset of labeled road sign images using TensorFlow. This involves feeding the images through the network and adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the error between the predicted class of an image and the true class.
Evaluation: Once the model is trained, it would be evaluated on a separate dataset of images to assess its performance. Metrics such as accuracy, precision.
